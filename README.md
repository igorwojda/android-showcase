The Android Showcase project exemplifies modern [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) application development methodologies and provides comprehensive architectural guidance. By integrating popular development tools, libraries, linters, and Gradle plugins, along with robust testing frameworks and Continuous Integration (CI) setup, this project offers a holistic sample of a fully operational Android application.

The primary focus of this project lies in promoting a modular, scalable, maintainable, and testable [architecture](#architecture). It incorporates a leading-edge [tech-stack](#tech-stack) and embodies the finest practices in software development. While the application may appear straightforward, it encompasses all the crucial components that lay the groundwork for a robust, large-scale application.

The design principles and architectural choices applied in this project are ideally suited for larger teams and extended [application lifecycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management). This application is not just about showcasing functionalities, but it is also a testament to how well-structured and well-written code serves as a stable backbone for scalable and maintainable software development projects.

## Application Scope

The android-showcase is a simple application that presents information about various music albums. This data is dynamically sourced from the [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/api)  music platform API.

The app has a few screens located in multiple feature modules:

- Album list screen - displays list of albums
- Album detail screen - display information about the selected album
- Profile screen - empty (WiP)
- Favourites screen - empty (WiP)
  <br/><br/>

## Architecture

By dividing a problem into smaller and easier-to-solve sub-problems, we can reduce the complexity of designing and
maintaining a large system. Each module is an independent build block serving a clear purpose. We can think about each
feature as a reusable component, the equivalent of [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) or private
library.

The modularized code-base approach provides a few benefits:

- reusability - enable code sharing and building multiple apps from the same foundation. Apps should be a sum of their features where the features are organized as separate modules.
- [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) - each module has a clear API.
  Feature-related classes live in different modules and can't be referenced without explicit module dependency. We
  strictly control what is exposed to other parts of your codebase.
- features can be developed in parallel eg. by different teams
- each feature can be developed in isolation, independently from other features
- faster build time

### Module Types And Module Dependencies

This diagram presents dependencies between project modules (Gradle sub-projects).

![module_dependencies](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/module_dependencies.png?raw=true)

We have three kinds of modules in the application:

- `app` module - this is the main module. It contains code that wires multiple modules together (class, dependency
  injection setup, `NavHostActivity`, etc.) and fundamental application configuration (retrofit configuration, required
  permissions setup, custom `Application` class, etc.).
- `feature_x` modules - the most common type of module containing all code related to a given feature.
  share some assets or code only between `feature` modules (currently app has no such modules)
- `feature_base` modules that feature modules depend on to share a common code.

### Feature Module Structure

`Clean Architecture` is implemented at the module level - each module contains its own set of Clean Architecture layers:

![module_dependencies_layers](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/module_dependencies_layers.png?raw=true)

> Notice that the `app` module and `library_x` modules structure differs a bit from the feature module structure.

Each feature module contains non-layer components and 3 layers with a distinct set of responsibilities.

![feature_structure](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/feature_structure.png?raw=true)

#### Presentation Layer

This layer is closest to what the user sees on the screen.

The `presentation` layer mixes `MVVM` and `MVI` patterns:

- `MVVM` - Jetpack `ViewModel` is used to encapsulate a `common UI state`. It exposes the `state` via observable state
  holder (`Kotlin Flow`)
- `MVI` - `action` modifies the `common UI state` and emits a new state to a view via `Kotlin Flow`

> The `common state` is a single source of truth for each view. This solution derives from
> [Unidirectional Data Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidirectional_Data_Flow_(computer_science)) and [Redux
> principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles).

This approach facilitates the creation of consistent states. The state is collected via `collectAsUiStateWithLifecycle`
method. Flows collection happens in a lifecycle-aware manner, so
[no resources are wasted](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/consuming-flows-safely-in-jetpack-compose-cde014d0d5a3).

Stated is annotated with [Immutable](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/Immutable)
annotation that is used by Jetpack compose to enable composition optimizations.

Components:

- **View (Fragment)** - observes common view state (through `Kotlin Flow`). Compose transform state (emitted by Kotlin
  Flow) into application UI Consumes the state and transforms it into application UI (via `Jetpack Compose`). Pass user
  interactions to `ViewModel`. Views are hard to test, so they should be as simple as possible.
- **ViewModel** - emits (through `Kotlin Flow`) view state changes to the view and deals with user interactions (these
  view models are not simply [POJO classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object)).
- **ViewState** - common state for a single view
- **StateTimeTravelDebugger** - logs actions and view state transitions to facilitate debugging.
- **NavManager** - singleton that facilitates handling all navigation events inside `NavHostActivity` (instead of
  separately, inside each view)

#### Domain Layer

This is the core layer of the application. Notice that the `domain` layer is independent of any other layers. This
allows making domain models and business logic independent from other layers. In other words, changes in other layers
will not affect the `domain` layer eg. changing the database (`data` layer) or screen UI (`presentation` layer) ideally will
not result in any code change within the `domain` layer.

Components:

- **UseCase** - contains business logic
- **DomainModel** - defines the core structure of the data that will be used within the application. This is the source
  of truth for application data.
- **Repository interface** - required to keep the `domain` layer independent from
  the `data layer` ([Dependency inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)).

#### Data Layer

Encapsulates application data. Provides the data to the `domain` layer eg. retrieves data from the internet and cache the
data in disk cache (when the device is offline).

Components:

- **Repository** is exposing data to the `domain` layer. Depending on the application structure and quality of the
  external API repository can also merge, filter, and transform the data. These operations intend to create
  a high-quality data source for the `domain` layer. It is the responsibility of the Repository (one or more) to construct
  Domain models by reading from the `Data Source` and accepting Domain models to be written to the `Data Source`
- **Mapper** - maps `data model` to `domain model` (to keep `domain` layer independent from the `data` layer).

This application has two `Data Sources` - `Retrofit` (used for network access) and `Room` (local storage used to access
device persistent memory). These data sources can be treated as an implicit sub-layer. Each data source consists of
multiple classes:

- **Retrofit Service** - defines a set of API endpoints
- **Retrofit Response Model** - definition of the network objects for a given endpoint (top-level model for the data
  consists of `ApiModels`)
- **Retrofit Api Data Model** - defines the network objects (sub-objects of the `Response Model`)
- **Room Database** - persistence database to store app data
- **Room DAO** - interact with the stored data
- **Room Entity** - definition of the stored objects

Both `Retrofit API Data Models` and `Room Entities` contain annotations, so the given framework understands how to parse the
data into objects.

### Data Flow

The below diagram presents application data flow when a user interacts with the `album list screen`:

![app_data_flow](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/app_data_flow.png?raw=true)

## Dependency Management

Gradle [versions catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:version-catalog) is used as a
centralized dependency management third-party dependency coordinates (group, artifact, version) are shared across all
modules (Gradle projects and subprojects).

All of the dependencies are stored in the [settings.gradle.kts](./settings.gradle.kts) file (default location).
Gradle versions catalog consists of a few major sections:

- `[versions]` - declare versions that can be referenced by all dependencies
- `[libraries]` - declare the aliases to library coordinates
- `[bundles]` - declare dependency bundles (groups)
- `[plugins]` - declare Gradle plugin dependencies

Each feature module depends on the `feature_base` module, so dependencies are shared without the need to add them
explicitly in each feature module.

The project enables the `TYPESAFE_PROJECT_ACCESSORS` experimental Gradle feature to generate type-safe accessors to refer other projects.

```kotlin
// Before
implementation(project(":feature_album"))

// After
implementation(projects.featureAlbum)
```

## Logcat debugging

To facilitate debuting project contains logs. You can filter logs to understand app flow. Keywords:
- `onCreate` see what `Activities` and `Fragments` have been created
- `Action` - filter all actions performed on the screens to update the UI
- `Http` - debug network requests and responses

## CI Pipeline

CI is utilizing [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). The complete GitHub Actions config is located in
the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) folder.

### Pull Request Verification

Series of workflows run (in parallel) for every opened PR, and after merging PR to the `main` branch:

- `./gradlew konsist_test:test --rerun-tasks` - checks that source code satisfies Konsist rules
- `./gradlew lintDebug` - checks that source code satisfies Android lint rules 
  - (create baseline using `./gradlew lintDebugBaseline`)
- `./gradlew detektCheck` - checks that sourcecode satisfies detekt rules
- `./gradlew spotlessCheck` - checks that source code satisfies formatting steps.
- `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` - run unit tests
- `./gradlew connectedCheck` - run UI tests
- `./gradlew :app:bundleDebug` - create an application bundle

The following tasks cab be executed locally to make codebase compliant with the rules:
- `./gradlew detektApply` - applies detekt code formatting rules to sourcecode in-place
- `./gradlew spotlessApply` - applies code formatting steps to the source code in place.
