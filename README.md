## Architecture

The project implements **Clean Architecture** with a modular approach, treating each feature as an independent, reusable component similar to a microservice. This design enables maintainability and scalability for large development teams.

**Benefits of Modular Architecture:**
- **Reusability** - Shared code across multiple app variants
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear module boundaries with explicit dependencies
- **Parallel Development** - Teams can work on features independently
- **Faster Build Times** - Incremental compilation and build caching
- **Testability** - Isolated testing of individual components

### Module Types and Dependencies

![Module Dependencies](./misc/image/module_type_dependencies.png)

**Module Types:**
- **`app`** - Main application module containing navigation setup, DI configuration, and app-level components
- **`feature-*`** - Feature modules (album, profile, favourite) containing feature-specific business logic  
- **`feature-base`** - Shared foundation module providing common utilities and base classes
- **`library-*`** - Utility modules for testing and shared functionality

### Feature Module Structure

`Clean Architecture` is implemented at the module level - each module contains its own set of Clean Architecture layers:

![module_dependencies_layers](./misc/image/module_dependencies_layers.png)

> Notice that the `app` module and `library_x` modules structure differs a bit from the feature module structure.

Each feature module contains non-layer components and 3 layers with a distinct set of responsibilities.

![feature_structure](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/feature_structure.png?raw=true)

#### Presentation Layer

This layer is closest to what the user sees on the screen.

The `presentation` layer mixes `MVVM` and `MVI` patterns:

- `MVVM` - Jetpack `ViewModel` is used to encapsulate a `common UI state`. It exposes the `state` via observable state
  holder (`Kotlin Flow`)
- `MVI` - `action` modifies the `common UI state` and emits a new state to a view via `Kotlin Flow`

> The `common state` is a single source of truth for each view. This solution derives from
> [Unidirectional Data Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidirectional_Data_Flow_(computer_science)) and [Redux
> principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles).

This approach facilitates the creation of consistent states. The state is collected via `collectAsUiStateWithLifecycle`
method. Flows collection happens in a lifecycle-aware manner, so
[no resources are wasted](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/consuming-flows-safely-in-jetpack-compose-cde014d0d5a3).

Stated is annotated with [Immutable](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/Immutable)
annotation that is used by Jetpack compose to enable composition optimizations.

Components:

- **Screen (Composable)** - observes common view state (through `Kotlin Flow`). Compose transform state (emitted by Kotlin
  Flow) into application UI Consumes the state and transforms it into application UI (via `Jetpack Compose`). Pass user
  interactions to `ViewModel`. Views are hard to test, so they should be as simple as possible.
- **ViewModel** - emits (through `Kotlin Flow`) view state changes to the view and deals with user interactions (these
  view models are not simply [POJO classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object)).
- **ViewState** - common state for a single view
- **StateTimeTravelDebugger** - logs actions and view state transitions to facilitate debugging.
- **NavManager** - singleton that facilitates handling all navigation events inside `NavHostActivity` (instead of
  separately, inside each view)

#### Domain Layer

This is the core layer of the application. Notice that the `domain` layer is independent of any other layers. This
allows making domain models and business logic independent from other layers. In other words, changes in other layers
will not affect the `domain` layer eg. changing the database (`data` layer) or screen UI (`presentation` layer) ideally will
not result in any code change within the `domain` layer.

Components:

- **UseCase** - contains business logic
- **DomainModel** - defines the core structure of the data that will be used within the application. This is the source
  of truth for application data.
- **Repository interface** - required to keep the `domain` layer independent from
  the `data layer` ([Dependency inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)).

#### Data Layer

Encapsulates application data. Provides the data to the `domain` layer eg. retrieves data from the internet and cache the
data in disk cache (when the device is offline).

Components:

- **Repository** is exposing data to the `domain` layer. Depending on the application structure and quality of the
  external API repository can also merge, filter, and transform the data. These operations intend to create
  a high-quality data source for the `domain` layer. It is the responsibility of the Repository (one or more) to construct
  Domain models by reading from the `Data Source` and accepting Domain models to be written to the `Data Source`
- **Mapper** - maps `data model` to `domain model` (to keep `domain` layer independent from the `data` layer).

This application has two `Data Sources` - `Retrofit` (used for network access) and `Room` (local storage used to access
device persistent memory). These data sources can be treated as an implicit sub-layer. Each data source consists of
multiple classes:

- **Retrofit Service** - defines a set of API endpoints
- **Retrofit Response Model** - definition of the network objects for a given endpoint (top-level model for the data
  consists of `ApiModels`)
- **Retrofit Api Data Model** - defines the network objects (sub-objects of the `Response Model`)
- **Room Database** - persistence database to store app data
- **Room DAO** - interact with the stored data
- **Room Entity** - definition of the stored objects

Both `Retrofit API Data Models` and `Room Entities` contain annotations, so the given framework understands how to parse the
data into objects.

### Data Flow

The below diagram presents application data flow when a user interacts with the `album list screen`:

![app_data_flow](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/app_data_flow.png?raw=true)

## Gradle Config

### Dependency Management

Gradle [versions catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:version-catalog) is used as a centralized dependency management third-party dependency coordinates (group, artifact, version) are shared across all modules (Gradle projects and subprojects).

All of the dependencies are stored in the [settings.gradle.kts](./settings.gradle.kts) file (default location).
Gradle versions catalog consists of a few major sections:

- `[versions]` - declare versions that can be referenced by all dependencies
- `[libraries]` - declare the aliases to library coordinates
- `[bundles]` - declare dependency bundles (groups)
- `[plugins]` - declare Gradle plugin dependencies

Each feature module depends on the `feature_base` module, so dependencies are shared without the need to add them explicitly in each feature module.

### Convention Plugins

[Convention plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_convention_plugins.html) standardize build configuration across modules:

- **`app-convention`** - Application module configuration
- **`library-convention`** - Library module setup with Android configuration  
- **`kotlin-convention`** - Kotlin compilation settings and toolchain
- **`test-convention`** - Testing framework setup (JUnit 5, test logging)
- **`detekt-convention`** - Code analysis rules
- **`spotless-convention`** - Code formatting enforcement

All convention plugins are located in [`buildSrc/src/main/kotlin`](./buildSrc/src/main/kotlin).

### Type Safe Project Accessors

Enables type-safe project references instead of error-prone string-based module paths:

```kotlin
// Before
implementation(project(":feature:album"))

// After  
implementation(projects.feature.album)
```

### Java Version

Java/JVM versions are centralized in [`JavaConfig.kt`](./buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/config/JavaConfig.kt):

```kotlin
object JavaConfig {
    val JAVA_VERSION: JavaVersion = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    val JVM_TARGET: JvmTarget = JvmTarget.JVM_17
    const val JVM_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION: Int = 17
}
```

## Code Verification

**Quality Checks:**
```bash
./gradlew konsistTest:test --rerun-tasks  # Architecture & convention validation
./gradlew lintDebug                       # Android lint analysis  
./gradlew detektCheck                     # Code complexity & style analysis
./gradlew spotlessCheck                   # Code formatting verification
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest              # Unit test execution
./gradlew connectedCheck                 # UI test execution (WIP)
./gradlew :app:bundleDebug               # Production build verification
```

**Auto-fix Commands:**
```bash
./gradlew detektApply                    # Apply Detekt formatting fixes
./gradlew spotlessApply                  # Apply code formatting fixes
./gradlew lintDebugBaseline              # Update lint baseline
```

### CI Pipeline

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows execute quality checks automatically:
- **PR Validation** - All checks run in parallel on pull requests
- **Main Branch Protection** - Post-merge validation ensures code quality
- **Automated Dependency Updates** - Renovate bot creates PRs for dependency updates

Configuration: [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows)

### Pre-push Hooks

Optional [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_push) can execute quality checks before pushing code, providing fast feedback during development.

## Development & Debugging

**Logging System:**
The app includes comprehensive logging for development debugging:

- `onCreate` - Activity and ViewModel lifecycle events
- `Action` - UI state changes and user interactions  
- `Http` - Network request/response details (debug builds only)
- `Navigation` - Screen transitions and routing

Filter logs by tag: `package:mine tag:Navigation`
