[![Kotlin Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-1.3.41-blue.svg)](http://kotlinlang.org/)

Showcase is a sample project that presents modern, 2019 approach to
[Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) application development using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and latest tech-stack.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate best practices, provide guidance and present flexible application architecture (modular, scalable, maintainable and testable architecture suitable for growing teams and longer
[application lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management)).

`Android showcase` will be heavily maintained to match up to date industry standards ⭐️.

# Improvements

 There are many things I personally want to try, play with and add to `android-showcase` project:
* Support for DayNight MaterialTheme
* Android Dynamic delivery
* Caching layer (memory + disk)
* Add Room
* UI tests (including CI pipeline emulator configuration)
* Data binding
* Custom lint, ktlint and detekt tasks
* Add script to update all dependencies in the project, create PR to run all checks
* Continuous deployment (automatically publish app to Google play store using CI)
* …
* 100+ other things to try, explore and potentially add here (seriously 🤓)
