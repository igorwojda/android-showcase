# Contributing

We appreciate contributions of any kind - new contributions
are welcome whether it's through bug reports or new pull requests.

## Tell us about enhancements and bugs

Please add an issue. We'll review it, add labels and reply when we get the chance.

## See an issue you'd like to work on

Comment on the issue that you'd like to work on and we'll add the
`claimed` label.  If you see the `claimed` label already on the issue you
might want to ask the contributor if they'd like some help.

## Documentation needs updating

Go right ahead! Just submit a pull request when you're done.

4. Make changes, push changes to your fork and
   [submit a pull request](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/compare) against the `main` branch.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within few days. We may suggest some
