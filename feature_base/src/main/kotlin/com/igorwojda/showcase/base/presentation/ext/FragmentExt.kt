/**
 * When trying to navigate to a destination that is not included in the current navigation graph
 * the app will crash:
 * java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Navigation action/destination X cannot be found
 *
 * This happens when a (second) navigation request is triggered from a fragment that is no longer the current
 * location (currentDestination) in the navController. In other words, when navigating from A to B, there is
 * a moment when:
 *     - Fragment A is still active and showing.
 *     - The navigation library already changed its current location,currentDestination, to Fragment B.
 *
 * Crash happens when a second request to navigate from fragment A comes in at exactly this moment (usually
 *  due to extremely fast clicking or multitouch), and it uses a destination that is not included in Bâ€™s graph.
 * See https://medium.com/@ffvanderlaan/fixing-the-dreaded-is-unknown-to-this-navcontroller-68c4003824ce
 *
 * This method navigates only if this is safely possible; when this Fragment is still the current destination.
